### Intro
Imagine you have been tasked by your boss to build the App component. The only thing App should do is show the Student component which was created by someone else on your team. You do the standard process of importing the component file and using the tag in JSX. 

If you look at the component itself, there is a lot of stuff going on in it. There are many lines of code and a lot of JSX mixing html and javascript. How will you figure out which props this component needs.
